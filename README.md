# ðŸ¤– Jarvis

This is my very first personal project which I coded back in 10th standard as my final project submission for ICSE Board exam.

Well it is a CLI based app which can do fun stuff and comprises of various small little programs like patterns, functions, constructors and other things that I practiced while learning how to code. This is where it all started! All the orignal code along with the then designed card are presented to you!

## Features

This is what you call a really feature rich program! It can not only interpret sentences and phrases but also be actually useful by performing basic tasks.

- Calculator app
- Patterns
- Remember Stuff
- Basic Conversions
- Conversion Skills
- Basic Math functions
